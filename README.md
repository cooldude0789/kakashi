### Description of Idea

- Idea : Presenting Vitaran, a website that bridges the gap between those who can give, and those who need.
Through Vitaran, one can decide to donate excess food left-over from the day’s party or a dinner gathering, anytime, and be able to do so!
- Problem : Hunger and Wastage of Food!

Stepping out of our comfortable homes, down onto the barren lanes of the slums, looking at little children’s sunken cheeks and jutting bones, we see one jarring problem that’s been around since eternity but still lies unresolved: hunger.
There’s hunger in their eyes and in their pitiful cries; yet we don’t think twice before emptying out the excess food on our plate right into the trash can.
Hunger is abundant, but so is wastage. This imbalance is stark and alarming.
Excess food and resources that are still fit for consumption must be consumed and not thrown. We need a medium through which those with the privilege of having more than necessary, can share it with those in need.
